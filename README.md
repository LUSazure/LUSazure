### About me
hey... :'D

wish me luck to finish my personal project this time,<br />
whether it be art or game or article...

oh also, ignore if there're many contributions,<br />
as they are pretty much likely me yapping on my [blog](https://lusazure.github.io/), lol

### Trivia
(Aug 28, '24)<br />
I'm getting the hang of it... still not sure.

- I first gotta organize my changes in "Staging Area"
- by "committing" with a summary according to their belongings,
- before I "push" them... to the real "Repo."

well, at least on VS Code...
